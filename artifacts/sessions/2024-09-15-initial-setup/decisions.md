# Technical Decisions - Initial Setup Session

## Technology Stack Decisions

### 1. Framework Choice: Next.js 15
**Decision**: Use Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
**Rationale**:
- Latest stable version with React 19 support
- App Router provides better organization for complex applications
- Built-in optimization for fonts, images, and performance
- Server-side rendering capabilities for better SEO
- API routes for backend functionality

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vite + React: Less opinionated but requires more configuration
- Remix: Good for forms but less ecosystem

---

### 2. React Version: React 19
**Decision**: Use React 19 (latest version)
**Rationale**:
- Latest features and performance improvements
- Better concurrent features
- Improved TypeScript support
- Next.js 15 officially supports it

**Trade-offs**:
- Bleeding edge, some third-party libraries may not be fully compatible
- Mitigation: Chose well-maintained libraries with React 19 support

---

### 3. Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS 4 with shadcn/ui component system
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- shadcn/ui provides high-quality, accessible components
- Consistent design system with customizable tokens
- Version 4 has improved performance and features

**Component System Choice**:
- **shadcn/ui over Chakra UI**: Better TypeScript support, more modern
- **shadcn/ui over Material-UI**: Less opinionated, easier customization
- **shadcn/ui over Ant Design**: Better for custom designs

**Configuration**:
- Style: "new-york" variant (clean, modern aesthetic)
- Base color: neutral (flexible for theme customization)
- CSS variables enabled for dynamic theming

---

### 4. Testing Strategy: Jest + React Testing Library
**Decision**: Use Jest 30 with React Testing Library
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for React testing
- Excellent component testing capabilities
- Good TypeScript support
- jsdom environment for browser simulation
- User-centric testing approach (behavior over implementation)

**Testing Philosophy**:
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Focus on user interactions and accessibility
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

**Additional Testing Tools**:
- `@testing-library/user-event`: User interaction simulation
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Custom matchers for DOM testing

---

### 5. Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Decision**: Strict TDD approach with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
**Rationale**:
- Ensures high code quality and test coverage
- Reduces bugs and regression issues
- Forces better component design
- Documentation through tests
- Confidence in refactoring

**TDD Workflow**:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. No implementation without tests

---

### 6. TypeScript Configuration: Strict Mode
**Decision**: Enable TypeScript strict mode with path aliases
**Rationale**:
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better developer experience with IntelliSense
- Easier refactoring
- Path aliases (@/) for cleaner imports

**Configuration Choices**:
- `@/` alias pointing to `src/` directory
- Strict null checks enabled
- No implicit any types
- Exact optional property types

---

### 7. Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier-like Formatting
**Decision**: Use ESLint with Next.js and TypeScript rules
**Rationale**:
- Consistent code style across team
- Catch potential bugs
- Enforce best practices
- Integration with IDE for real-time feedback

---

### 8. Component Architecture: Directory-per-Component
**Decision**: Each component gets its own directory with test and index files
**Rationale**:
- Clear organization and separation of concerns
- Easy to locate component-related files
- Supports component-scoped styling if needed
- Makes testing alongside implementation obvious

**Structure**:
```
ComponentName/
├── ComponentName.tsx
├── ComponentName.test.tsx
└── index.ts
```

---

### 9. State Management: React Built-ins (Future Decision)
**Decision**: Start with React's built-in state management
**Rationale**:
- useState and useContext sufficient for initial development
- Avoid premature optimization
- Can add Zustand/Redux later if needed

**Future Considerations**:
- Zustand for global state if app grows complex
- React Query for server state management
- Context API for theme and user preferences

---

### 10. Animation Library: tw-animate-css
**Decision**: Use tw-animate-css for animations
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and integrates well with Tailwind
- Good performance
- Easy to use with existing CSS classes
- Can upgrade to Framer Motion later if needed

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Folder Structure
**Decision**: Feature-based organization within technical layers
```
src/
├── app/ (Next.js App Router)
├── components/ (Reusable UI components)
├── lib/ (Utilities and helpers)
├── hooks/ (Custom React hooks - future)
└── types/ (TypeScript definitions - future)
```

### 2. Component Design Patterns
**Decision**: Functional components with hooks
**Rationale**:
- Modern React patterns
- Better TypeScript integration
- Easier testing
- Performance benefits with React 19

### 3. Props Design
**Decision**: Explicit TypeScript interfaces for all component props
**Rationale**:
- Better documentation
- Compile-time type checking
- IDE IntelliSense support
- Easier refactoring

---

## Development Workflow Decisions

### 1. Git Strategy
**Decision**: Conventional Commits with descriptive messages
**Rationale**:
- Clear commit history
- Automated changelog generation possible
- Easy to understand changes
- Good for team collaboration

### 2. Documentation Strategy
**Decision**: Comprehensive documentation in multiple formats
- CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance
- README.md for human developers
- Artifacts folder for session tracking
- Inline JSDoc for complex functions

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with proper error boundaries
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience
- Easier debugging
- Prevents app crashes
- Good for accessibility

---

## Decisions for Future Sessions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
2. **Authentication**: Next-Auth.js or Clerk
3. **AI Integration**: OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
4. **State Management**: Consider Zustand for complex state

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting
2. **Monitoring**: Error tracking and analytics
